# RaspberryPiTemp

Programmed using Python on a Raspberry Pi, the program collects temperature data at regular intervals, saving it into a file and using an attached LCD to display the temperature as well as the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded since recording begins. 
A voice notification alerts the user when monitoring completes.
